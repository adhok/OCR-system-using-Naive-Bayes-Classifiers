# OCR system using Naive Bayes Classifiers

This project tries to emulate a spam filter using Naive Bayes classifier. The dataset is obtained from the GrumbleText Website.
The dataset consists of around 3183 SMS messages which have been classified into spam and ham. Classifiers based on Bayesian methods utilize
training data to calculate an observed probability of each class. When the classifier is then used on unlabelled data it uses the observed
probabilities to predict the most likely class for the new features. The Laplace Estimator is used to create non zero estimates
in case of the likelihood event probability being zero.
